# ABAP Library

This repository represents my personal reusable ABAP code library. Feel free to use or contribute!

Files reside in clean sub-folders for the sake of organization.

Many classes here also represent sample implementations of [ABAP design patterns](https://www.sap-press.com/design-patterns-in-abap-objects_4277/). None of those files include any company-specific functional logic - so there are no "trade secrets" revealed.

## Dependencies

Some of the files need the following ABAP libraries, which can easily be installed via [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit) :
- [Addict](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/addict)
- [Simbal](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/simbal)
- [TickSys](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/ticksys)
